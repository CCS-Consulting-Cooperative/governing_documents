$500 per year quoted seems reasonable to Josh

We each pay $15 per month currently in dues. We have four people paying dues currently (James, Bob, Kelly, Josh) which is $60 per month. There are monthly expenditures that need to be indexed.

$500 / 12 = rounding up $42, divided by 4 is $10.50.

I propose raising the dues by $10.50 to cover the insurance fees.

Or, we all pay $100 this month to cover 1 year of insurance


## Additional Items for Discussion:



## Next Steps:

- Action Item ( by March 2nd ) vote on either increasing dues by $10.50 to $25.50 or each paying $100 this month for insurance
