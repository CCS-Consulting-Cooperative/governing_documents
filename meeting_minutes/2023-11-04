Meeting about voting on bank account ownership and who should receive debit cards to the CCS account.

Tiffany from SSB War Road needs us to send her public minutes that indicate who wants to be a debit card holder.

There are a couple of expenditures (our DNS name, Google Cloud) which are recurring and will continue to draw from that account. And, we are making deposits through Stripe monthly.


Voting on this matter:

"Shall Joshua Arnott Benson and James Allen Munsch receive debit cards per the legal requirements of Security State Bank War Road linked to the business account of CCS Consulting?"
James: yes
Robert: yes
Joshua: yes

âœ… The measure is adopted
