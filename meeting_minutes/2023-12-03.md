## Item 1: (Governing Docs)

**Presenter:** Kelly

- Governing Docs Updates:
	I reviewed the docs. We should discuss cleaning up / providing more clarity on how things may be handled if a member resigns.  Under Member Resignation, it says that the resignation will take effect immediately and that this person is not allowed to work for the cooperative for one month. Does this mean we don’t take a time notice and they will lose their access immediately? As well, for the costs they’re responsible for, is that for the year? Or at what point are they no longer responsible for the costs?
- Veridomo:
	- Discuss content/questions on the (Veridomo) Project Summary and Feasibility Google Doc
		- Review Google keyword search results  
		- Ideas on how we estimate is the total demand for this service?
		- Then what do we estimate is the serviceable available market? 
	- Competitors 
		- Google Site Verification API 
		- Any others?
		- How could we differentiate ourselves?
	- What would our rough monetary goal be to make this worth it? 

**Expected Outcome:** Hypothesize what our expected TAM and SAM are that will inform what our next action items should be i.e., draft a flow for V1 and V2, marketing website content, etc.
