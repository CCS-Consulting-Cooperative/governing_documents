Mondragon and other worker cooperatives have unique systems for calculating surplus, distributing dividends, and managing membership buy-in fees. Here's a detailed explanation:

# Surplus Calculation:

In cooperatives like Mondragon, the surplus is the economic profit generated by the cooperative's activities. The calculation of surplus follows these general steps:

1. Determine the total revenue earned by the cooperative.
2. Subtract the costs of goods sold, operating expenses, taxes, and other necessary deductions.
3. Allocate a portion of the remaining funds to required reserves, such as the cooperative's reserve fund and social funds (e.g., education and community development).
4. The remaining amount is the surplus available for distribution to members.

# Membership Buy-in Fees:

To become a member of a worker cooperative, individuals often pay a buy-in fee or purchase a membership share. This fee represents the member's ownership stake in the cooperative. The buy-in fee can serve several purposes:

1. It provides capital for the cooperative's operations and investments.
2. It ensures members have a financial stake in the success of the cooperative.
3. It helps maintain the cooperative's financial stability and independence.

The amount of the buy-in fee varies among cooperatives and may be based on factors such as the cooperative's financial needs, the value of its assets, and the potential earning capacity of the member.

# Surplus Distribution and Dividends:

Once the surplus is calculated, cooperatives like Mondragon distribute a portion of it to members as dividends. The most common methods for distributing dividends are:

1. Patronage-based distribution: Dividends are allocated based on the amount of work each member has contributed to the cooperative. This is often measured by the number of hours worked or the member's salary.

2. Equal distribution: The surplus is divided equally among all members, regardless of their individual contributions.

3. Combination of patronage and equal distribution: Some cooperatives use a hybrid approach, distributing a portion of the surplus based on patronage and the remainder equally among members.

4. Retained earnings: A portion of the surplus may be retained by the cooperative for future investments, capital improvements, or as a reserve fund.

In Mondragon, the surplus distribution follows a unique system called the "capital accounts" method. Each member has an individual capital account, which represents their share of the cooperative's assets. The surplus is distributed to these accounts based on the member's labor contribution and the cooperative's overall performance. Members can withdraw funds from their capital accounts upon retirement or leaving the cooperative, subject to certain conditions.

It's important to note that the specific methods for calculating surplus, determining buy-in fees, and distributing dividends may vary among cooperatives based on their bylaws, industry, and local regulations. The examples provided here are general representations of common practices in worker cooperatives like Mondragon.

Once membership is mutually accepted, the worker has 36 months to contribute his or her initial capital share of €15,000 , which represents the system’s minimum annual salary. This can be amortized through salary deductions, or in some cases borrowed from a bank as “capital to work.”

Membership places workers in particular social and economic relationships with each other and the cooperative. Workers start out with the same salary for the same job, with raises for seniority kicking in every 3-5 years, depending on the cooperative, and retirement is compulsory at 65 years.

Principles of internal and external solidarity place restrictions on the distance between the highest and lowest paid workers, building from the basis of the €15,000 minimum salary. In most cases, no worker can earn more than 4.5 times that base amount (€67,500). In the largest cooperatives, where management responsibilities might be very high, the wage ceiling is six times the €15,000 base (€90,000).

Is this true? Surplus and dividend distribution is calculated at Mondragon as 20% of profits equally to members?

# Capital Accounts:

In the Mondragon cooperative system, member capital accounts play a crucial role in the financial relationship between the cooperative and its members, including during resignation and retirement. Here's how the process works:

# Cashing Out Members After Resignation:

When a member resigns from a Mondragon cooperative, they are entitled to receive the balance of their capital account, which represents their share of the cooperative's assets. However, the payout process is not immediate and follows certain rules:

1. The cooperative typically establishes a waiting period (e.g., several years) before the resigning member can receive the full balance of their capital account.
2. During this waiting period, the resigning member's capital account balance may continue to earn interest based on the cooperative's performance.
3. The cooperative may pay out the capital account balance in installments over a specified period to ensure financial stability and to avoid a sudden drain on the cooperative's resources.
4. If the cooperative experiences financial difficulties, the payout of resigning members' capital accounts may be delayed or adjusted to prioritize the cooperative's survival.

# Use of Capital Accounts in Retirement:

For Mondragon cooperative members, capital accounts serve as a form of retirement savings. When a member reaches retirement age, they can start withdrawing funds from their capital account. The specific rules for retirement withdrawals may vary among cooperatives but generally follow these principles:

1. Members can choose to receive their capital account balance as a lump sum or in the form of periodic payments (similar to an annuity).
2. The cooperative may set a maximum annual withdrawal limit to ensure the financial stability of the cooperative and to prevent a significant outflow of funds in a single year.
3. In some cases, the cooperative may continue to credit interest to the retiree's capital account based on the cooperative's performance, even during the withdrawal phase.

# Adding Surplus to Capital Accounts:

Each year, when the cooperative generates a surplus, a portion of it is allocated to members' capital accounts. The allocation is typically based on each member's labor contribution and the cooperative's overall performance. The process works as follows:

1. After the surplus is calculated and the necessary deductions (e.g., taxes, reserves) are made, the remaining amount is available for distribution to members.
2. The surplus is divided among the members based on their individual labor contributions, which can be measured by factors such as hours worked or salary earned.
3. Each member's share of the surplus is credited to their capital account, increasing the account balance.
4. The cooperative may set a limit on the maximum amount of surplus that can be allocated to a single member's capital account to maintain a fair distribution of wealth.

# Former Members:

When a member leaves the cooperative (either through resignation or retirement), they no longer actively participate in the cooperative's decision-making processes or share in the surplus distribution. However, their capital account balance remains with the cooperative until it is fully paid out according to the cooperative's rules for resignation or retirement.

It's important to note that the specific rules and procedures for cashing out members, using capital accounts in retirement, and allocating surplus may vary among different Mondragon cooperatives and other cooperative systems.
