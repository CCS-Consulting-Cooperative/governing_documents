# Meeting at DOUBLE TROUBLE ATX

1) We voted on and agreed on using a weekly allocation of 10 hours per week per clown member
2) We agreed on using this google sheet for entering our time spent https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/1roVfcXRXceeSxvBQwfqKTmzuLT7v6eM6Bayq7Hbw1_Q/edit#gid=0
3) The above sheet has a section showing an example of breaking down profit sharing once there is excess profit from a project
4) James and Bob created a new version of ccsconsulting.rocks and Josh setup a github action .yml file to build and deploy to Firebase when the main branch of the repo is updated. Going forward, we can update the site by merging PRs into the main branch: https://github.com/CCS-Consulting-Cooperative/ccs-consulting-landing-page
5) Agreed to meet next Saturday at the same time but for a shorter amount of time
6) We logged all of the time spent on the coop in the last four months in the above sheet
