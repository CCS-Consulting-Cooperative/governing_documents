## Discussion:

###CCS Protocol Update Proposal: Productivity/Contribution Guidelines###
- Need to draft, vote, and then implement a set of rules regarding CCS personnel completing tasks on time
- There needs to be guardrails in place to ensure that everyone understands how important this work is and treats it appropriately to ensure due diligence is followed at all times
- The emphasis of this should be course correction instead of discipline - pushing people to voice problems/blockers earlier and communicate their hardships and struggles if they arise while working on a contract; everyone should be encouraged to speak up first so that the team can find solutions to keep everything progressing forward
- TLDR: We are being paid real money, we need to treat our contracts as real professional work
- Repeated problems may result in disciplinary measures

###CCS Contract Update Proposal: SLAs/Rush Hours###
- We need to write verbiage into our contracts that clarifies our approach to SLAs
- There should be levels that are "Standard/Normal" and "Rush/Urgent"
  - We need to establish timeframes for these
  - We also need to establish a higher price point for Rush/Urgent hours
    - The intended effect is two fold: more money gained while also discouraging clients from expecting 24/7 support outside of standard business hours, but giving them the option to request something while paying higher rates
- Alongside this, we should consider how to enact an oncall rotation
  - Whoever is running this is NOT absolutely required to respond to issues immediately; triaging would occur 
    - This person would also be responsible for determining if Rush/Urgent hours are viable; i.e., someone is available to do the work and capable of solving it; if not, then a ticket is logged and is passed to the team to work on during the next business hours
- Note that this does NOT cover showstopper/breaker/blocker style problems that require immediate hot fixes; such situations would be considered standard work that we are responsible for delivering
