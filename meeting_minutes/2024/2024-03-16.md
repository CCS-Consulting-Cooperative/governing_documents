## 9Zero/TechInSF Contract Update

James and Bob can provide updates on this contract.  Work has progressed smoothly as we have worked to set up Zapier integrations, test them, and update information/settings inside of the various services/apps that are being used by the client (such as Hubspot, Chargebee, DocuSign, and so on).

## 1120-C: Taxes

**Presenter:** Bob

Crystal completed a review of the 1120-C application on 3/11/24.  Her notes were as follows:

1) Because we - as a company - made under $250,000 in fiscal year 2023, question 14 of Schedule K was answered yes; this means we do not have to fill out Schedules G (Page 3), L (Page 5), M-1 (Page 5), or M-2 (Page 5).
2) She noted that she accepts the financials as correct/valid.
3) She was able to review the form very quickly, and as such, did not charge us to complete the work.

At this time, James knows what changes to be made (clear out the aforementioned Schedules listed above, confirm the financial numbers one last time) and can turn this form once completed.

## Additional Items for Discussion:

- Emily introduction, sending out an application for membership.
- Update on asking William Bausman if he'd be open to a PT apprenticeship to setup GCloud Functions, and/or Zapier flows at $? per zap, and/or gcloud javascript using the serverless framework
